Hello. I'm Maekawa Toshiki.
I'm researching on natural language processing and understanding in Chandrasekhar Project.
Chandrasekhar Project is one of the science clubs in my school.
Today I'll tell you my research.
First, look at this sentence. 'HOW WILL THE WEATHER BE'
OK? If you are human beings, you are able to understand what this sentence means.
But this is a difficult problem for computers.
Because this sentence is just a string, so it has no meaning for computers.
These years, computers have been developing and getting great results even ordinary people know in the feild of image recognion or voice recognition.
Self-driving cars or voice input are good examples.
How about the field of 'natural language'? Do you know AI assistants such as Siri or Google Assistant?
If you've ever used it, you know that they give up understanding meanings of a bit hard questions.
Then I thought I couldn't do something.
This was exactly the chance I began to do research on making computers abstract meanings of sentences.
